# Javascript Pure Function for OOP developer

A pure function is a function in which output depends only on its input without side effects.

Side effects are anything outside of the function that either influences it or is influenced by it.

## Pure functions and inversion of control with dependency injection

(纯函数和依赖注入的控制反转)

Inversion of control means that a framework is calling your function to execute custom purpose.

Dependency injection is a type of inversion of control. Dependency is an external code that your function is dependent on, and injection is the act of providing it to your function.
